# Graduate JS exercise

Hello, thanks for taking the time to complete this exercise.

## Setup

Clone this repo and run `npm install` in your terminal. NodeJS 16.16.0 or newer is recommended.

## Instructions

Please submit you original work. Feel free to lookup information on the Internet, but do not copy and paste solutions you don't fully understand. As a rule of thumb, you should be able to complete this exercise in under 2 hours. If you can't, you'll almost certainly struggle in the next interview round.

### Run the tests

Before you do anything else, run `npm test` in your terminal. This will will run the tests and you will find that all the tests are currently failing. This is OK, you'll fix this soon.

### Implementation

This exercise consists of three tasks defined in the `./src` directory. Each task contains a test file (`index.test.js`) with tests the expected functionality (do not change it). These tests also describe what the function should do, so read them carefully. It is up to you to implement a function in `index.js` within the same directory, so that the tests pass.

Note that `index.js` may contain additional information which may be useful to you for the function you implemented.

## Submission

Publish you solution to a public GitHub repo and send a link to your recruitment agent.
