Separate movements into two different axis:
- x-axis = E, W
- y-axis = N, S

Map movements with integer values:
- N, E = 1
= S, W = -1

For each line of input.txt:
- Calculate the sum of all x-axis movements in that line
- Calculate the sum of all y-axis movements in that line
- If one of those is not 0, then the person didn't
end up in the same position

## Extension
- Calculate the total sum of all x-axis movements
- Calculate the total sum of all y-axis movements
- If one of those is not 0, then the person didn't
end up in the same position
